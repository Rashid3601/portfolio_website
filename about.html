        <h2>About my career aspirations after this course</h2>
        <h3>Before I started my codenation course</h3>
    <p>
        Before I started this codenation course I was on 
        a bit of a career crossroad as it was just past 
        the pandemic. Job opportunities were scarce and for
        the past several years I have worked within sales 
        and I believe I was stuck in a position within my
        career where I could not find real career 
        progression or see any trajectory to grow my 
        career in any type of way. I decided that I would
        educate myself on coding to become a duel threat, most 
        coders are not adept at sales and business and most 
        sales people cannot code and don't understand technology 
        So I believe I can become a unique asset within any 
        organisation I join in the future if I am adept on
        both skillsets.

         <h3>My current situation and future career aspirations</h3>
      <p>
          Now that I have finished my codenation course I feel 
          a lot more confident using and understanding technology.
          I know the basics of using python and I used HTML and 
          CSS to make this particular website. I also learned how
          to work within a team and use Trello and Slack to 
          organise my work load within a team. I hope I can use 
          these tool to organise my life and balance several 
          projects at the same time. Now I believe I can put myself
          forward to apply for junior developer roles and to have
          an apprenticeship with a company to become a full-stack 
          developer which is my future aspiration in my career.
